# fruit_name_prediction
##### 1.Using k-NN classifier we predict the fruit name 
##### 2.we first load the fruit dataset into dataframe using read_table.
##### 3.Examining the data by visualization
##### 4. divide the data into 2 parts,1st for training the algorithm and 2nd testing the algorith
##### 5.create KNeighborsClassifier
##### 6.fit the training data into classifier ,then estimate the accuracy using test data
##### 7.Use the trained k-NN classifier model to classify new, previously unseen objects
